Neural Style Transfer for Artistic Image Generation

This project demonstrates Neural Style Transfer, a process that applies the artistic style of one image to the content of another image using deep learning. The neural network extracts the style features from a reference image (e.g., a famous painting) and combines them with the content features of another image to generate a new, stylized output.

Project Overview
Neural Style Transfer is based on the idea of using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to decompose an image into content and style features. By balancing these features, we can create a hybrid image that maintains the original content of a photograph while reflecting the style of an artistic image.

The VGG19 network, a pre-trained deep CNN, is used in this project to extract the style and content representations of images. The project optimizes both style loss and content loss to generate new, artistically stylized images.


The core process involves:

Content Image: The image whose structure and objects should be preserved (e.g., a landscape or a portrait).
Style Image: The image whose artistic texture, colors, and patterns will be transferred (e.g., a painting or artwork).
Generated Image: The final output, where the content image has been stylized with the texture and style patterns of the style image.

The project uses gradient descent to optimize the pixel values of the generated image such that it minimizes a combination of the style and content losses.
